# NovaLang Examples

These samples are intentionally minimal and focus on syntax and semantics
rather than runtime behavior.

- `pipeline.nova` demonstrates pipelines and function declarations.
- `options.nova` demonstrates sum types and `match` (use `nova-check --skip-codegen`).
- `loop.nova` demonstrates `while` with a boolean condition.
